# SkyView

## Project Overview
SkyView is a capstone project developed at the Software Engineering Department of ORT Braude College. This project represents Phase B of a deep study into the dynamics of planetary motion using classical Newtonian mechanics as a predictive tool against actual astronomical observations.

## Features

Welcome to SkyView! Our web application offers a variety of functionalities designed for both enthusiasts and researchers in astronomy. Here's what you can explore within SkyView:

- **Explore Built-in Simulations**: Dive into our pre-configured simulations to witness the realistic movements of planets and other celestial phenomena.

- **Create Your Own Simulations**: Design and customize your own planetary simulations. Adjust parameters to see how different variables affect interactions between celestial bodies.

- **Object Movement Detection**: Upload astronomical images, and our application will analyze them to detect and track the movements of objects across the sky.

- **Discover Space with NASA**: Gain access to the latest astronomical data and imagery through our integration with the NASA API.
